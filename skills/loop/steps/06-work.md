description: Execute one unit of loop work — claim, bootstrap a worktree, run the engine, release
---

## Goal

Run one worker cycle: select and durably claim the next eligible card, bootstrap
an isolated worktree, execute the configured engine headless, record a
crash-safe run ledger, and release the lease.

Claim, dispatch marking, checkpoint/finalization, and release are pushed from
an isolated detached PM Git transaction. They never commit, pull, reset, or
restore the operator's shared PM checkout. Each push uses compare-and-swap
against the fetched upstream OID and fails closed if ownership or the expected
card revision changes.

## How

Preview first (no claim, no execution):

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/loop-worker.js --project-dir "$PWD" --dry-run
```

Execute one unit of work:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/loop-worker.js --project-dir "$PWD"
```

The default mode covers the full lifecycle in priority order (ship cycles for
in-flight PRs first, then new dev work, then rfc/research if their autonomy
dials allow). Pass `--mode dev|ship|research` to restrict a wake to one lane.

The worker refuses to run when:

- `pm/loop/STOP` exists (kill switch — commit and push it to halt every machine),
- the daily run budget is spent — dev/rfc/research runs count against
  `budgets.max_runs_per_day`; ship cycles have their own
  `budgets.max_ship_cycles_per_day` so a slow PR can't starve dev dispatch,
- the card already failed `budgets.max_attempts_per_stage` times at this stage
  (`attempts-exhausted` — the card needs a human look),
- both implementation gates are not true (`autonomy.start_dev` + per-card
  `implementation_approved`/`approved_by`/`approved_at`),
- the lease cannot be committed AND pushed (no durable claim, no dispatch).

Claim atomically writes the lease and
`pm/loop/events/<run_id>.json`. Immediately before engine execution, the worker
durably changes both records to `dispatched`. A validated result can then be
checkpointed in `pm/loop/recovery/<run_id>.json` with the lease phase set to
`finalizing`; finalization writes the terminal event, card and allowlisted
artifacts while deleting recovery and lease in one CAS commit.

Before selecting new work, the next wake reads remote transaction state. It
distinguishes `never-dispatched`, `dispatched-without-terminal-result`,
`recovery-ready`, finalized, and ambiguous runs. Any non-final state returns
`recovery-required` instead of executing the engine again. An expired lease
with recovery remains recovery-only.

Every claimed dispatch writes a ledger — including rejections — so budgets and
the attempts backstop always advance. Worktrees are removed after every run
(ship worktrees especially, so the PR branch is free for the next cycle);
failed dev run branches are deleted; set `worker.keep_workspace: true` to keep
them for debugging.

Engine selection comes from `pm/loop/config.json` → `worker.engine`
(`codex` | `claude`) or `worker.engine_bin` for a custom command. Projects with
gitignored-but-required files (env files, generated specs) must list them in
`worker.bootstrap_files` so fresh worktrees don't fail their first test run.

Results land in the local state dir: ledger at `.pm/loop-runs/<run_id>.json`,
engine logs under `.pm/loop-runs/<run_id>/`.

A card's lifecycle spans multiple wakes by design — ship is event-driven
(CI runs, remote review rounds) and cannot finish in one engine run:

- **Implement wake** (`stage: dev`, budget `max_runtime_seconds_per_run`):
  fresh worktree → dev workflow → PR opened → card updated to
  `status: shipping` + `branch` + `prs`. Never merges.
- **Ship wakes** (`stage: ship`, budget `max_runtime_seconds_per_ship_cycle`):
  each wake checks out the existing branch and runs ONE bounded cycle —
  assess CI + new review comments, fix what's actionable, push, stop. Rounds
  of remote review each get absorbed by a subsequent wake. With
  `autonomy.merge_pr: true` the cycle merges when everything is green and
  marks the card done; with `false` it parks the green PR as needs-human for
  your merge.

When summarizing the JSON result:

- `completed` — this wake's stage finished cleanly; say which stage and what
  the next wake will do (ship cycle, next sibling, or nothing).
- `failed` / `timeout` / `bootstrap-failed` — report the reason and log paths;
  the lease was released either way.
- `recovery-required` — a durable claim, dispatch, recovery checkpoint, or
  ambiguous orphan must be resolved without redispatching the engine.
- `stopped` / `disabled` / `budget-exhausted` / `attempts-exhausted` / `rejected` / `idle` / `blocked` — nothing ran (any lease was released); report why.

Close by telling the user the outcome, where the logs are, and what needs human attention next.
