# pm:ingest

Import customer evidence into PM.

## Workflow Loading

Load the ingest workflow steps using the step loader:

```
const { loadWorkflow, buildPrompt } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/step-loader');
const steps = loadWorkflow('ingest', pmDir, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}');
const workflowPrompt = buildPrompt(steps);
```

The step loader reads step files from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ingest/steps/` (defaults) with user overrides from `.pm/workflows/ingest/` (if any). Steps are sorted by order and concatenated into the workflow prompt.

Execute the loaded workflow steps in order. Each step contains its own instructions.

## Path Resolution

If `pm_dir` is not in conversation context, check if `pm/` exists at cwd. If yes, use it (same-repo mode). If no, tell the user: 'Run pm:start first to configure paths.' Do not proceed without a valid path.

## Setup Expectations

`$pm-ingest` does **not** require full `$pm-setup`, but it does require the PM folder structure.

If the folders do not exist yet, bootstrap the minimum structure automatically:

```bash
mkdir -p {pm_dir}/evidence/research
mkdir -p {pm_dir}/evidence/transcripts
mkdir -p {pm_dir}/evidence/user-feedback
mkdir -p .pm/imports
mkdir -p .pm/evidence
mkdir -p .pm/sessions
```

Also ensure `.pm/` is present in the project root `.gitignore` without duplicating the line.

Do not block on setup just because the user wants to import evidence first.

## Custom Instructions

Before starting work, check for user instructions:

1. If `{pm_dir}/instructions.md` exists, read it — these are shared team instructions (terminology, writing style, output format, competitors to track).
2. If `{pm_dir}/instructions.local.md` exists, read it — these are personal overrides that take precedence over shared instructions on conflict.
3. If neither file exists, proceed normally.

**Override hierarchy:** `{pm_dir}/strategy.md` wins for strategic decisions (ICP, priorities, non-goals). Instructions win for format preferences (terminology, writing style, output structure). Instructions never override skill hard gates.

## Interaction Pacing

Ask ONE question at a time. Wait for the user's answer before asking the next. Do not bundle multiple questions in a single message. When you have follow-ups, ask the most important one first — the answer often makes the others unnecessary.

## Telemetry (opt-in)

If analytics are enabled, read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/telemetry.md`.

Minimum coverage for `pm:ingest`:
- run start / run end
- one step span for `intake`
- one step span for `normalize`
- one step span for `synthesize`

If a manifest or findings file is updated, pass the artifact path as `--output-file` so token estimates are tied to the real artifact size.

## Guardrails

1. Do not commit raw customer evidence into `{pm_dir}/`.
2. Do not invent structure for sparse or messy evidence.
3. Do not overwrite external research sections in mixed topic files.
4. Use portable labels in committed source references.
5. Prefer a full rebuild over a silent, incorrect incremental merge.
