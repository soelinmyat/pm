## Retro — Compound Learning

Runs after EVERY task regardless of size.

1. Review session: what was smooth, what was hard, any pitfalls or wasted cycles
2. Write to the learnings file (`learnings.md`) — flat table, each entry max 3 lines (one-liner preferred)

```markdown
| Date | Category | Learning |
|------|----------|----------|
| 2026-02-15 | Testing | Mock handlers for sideloaded resources must include related data |
```

3. If learnings suggest AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md updates — flag to user, don't auto-modify
4. If a learning is a "review should catch this" anti-pattern, and a review checklist exists (e.g., `.claude/references/review-checklist.md`), append it under the appropriate section
5. Cap: 50 entries. Archive >3 months old to `docs/archive/learnings-archive.md`

### Linear retro comment (M/L/XL)

**Linear** (if available):
```
mcp__plugin_linear_linear__save_comment({ issueId: "{ISSUE_ID}", body: "{learnings summary}" })
```

## State File ({source_dir}/.pm/dev-sessions/{slug}.md)

The state file is the **single source of truth** for session state. Updated at every stage transition and task completion. **Deleted after retro.**

**Repo location:** Dev sessions always live in the source repo's `.pm/dev-sessions/` directory — even in separate-repo mode. This keeps dev state co-located with the code being modified. In same-repo mode, `source_dir` == cwd, so the path is `.pm/dev-sessions/{slug}.md` as before.

After compaction or if context feels stale, read this file to recover full session state.

## Linear Context (if sourced from Linear)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Linear ID | {ID or null} |
| Linear readiness | dev-ready / needs-groom / null |
| Linear fetch | succeeded / failed / null |
| Linear gaps | [missing-ac, vague-scope, unclear-size] or [] |
| Linear labels | {labels or []} |

## Resume Instructions
- Stage: [current stage name]
- Next action: [single next action to take]
- Key context: [1-2 sentences a cold reader needs]
- Blockers: [any blocking issues, or "none"]
```

**Valid Stage values:** `intake`, `workspace`, `rfc-check`, `rfc-generation`, `rfc-review`, `rfc-approved`, `implement`, `simplify`, `design-critique`, `qa`, `review`, `ship`, `retro`.

The `rfc-approved` stage means: RFC was approved by the user, but they chose to stop and resume implementation in a new session. On resume, skip to Implementation via the resume path.

**Update rules:**
- Write the full file (not append) at each stage transition
- Keep `Stage started at` current at every stage transition and set `Completed at` when the session finishes
- Include all decisions made so far — a cold reader should understand the full context
- After design critique, add the report path
- Resume Instructions section must be populated at every stage transition. A cold reader should be able to continue the session from this section alone.
- After retro, delete the file
